Horiseon is a project that required HTML and CSS refactoring.

I approached the topic by getting myself familiar with the html layout, understanding the classes and IDs
and then started to refactor the code. Many repetitive divs and classes were removed in lieu of HTML5 and
CSS3 naming and display conventions. The result is a less bloated file that helps the page render faster 
and also organizes the information in the CSS in a manner that is easier to read and edit. 

Future work with the company will include making the website fully reactive to mobile.
